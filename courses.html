                Mosaic Course - 400KR <br />Our Mosaic Course introduces guests
                to the relaxing craft of arranging glass, tile, and stone into
                unique designs. Participants learn mosaic basics—selecting

                groups, the workshop provides a friendly environment where
                everyone can create comfortably and leave with a finished mosaic
                artwork that reflects their imagination and shared
                experience.<br />
                Set includes a frame, an A4 wood plate, decorative colored
                stones, and rubber pieces.
